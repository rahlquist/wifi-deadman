# wifi-deadman
A promiscous mode wifi scanner that looks for MAC matching a predetermined list. 

The goal was to see when a MAC disappears, and when it does trigger 
a response (react()) so that when a device leaves or is powered off 
more physical resources can be powered down without connecting.
